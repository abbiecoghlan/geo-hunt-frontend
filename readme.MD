# Geo Hunt üîé
Geo Hunt is an interactive, location-based geography trivia game. Users are given hints to guess a location and use the interactive map, provided by a Google Maps API, to guess and find the location. The application also keeps track of the users game stats through a dynamic leaderboard.
